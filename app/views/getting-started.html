	Linking to an existing heroku app rather than creating a new one: say your friend created an app on heroku but you've been working on the same code directly from github, when it comes time to push from your local repo to github you'll need to:

NOTE: try this instead:

heroku login

git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/mb-prototype-test.git

then you can:
git push heroku


other useful commands:
heroku apps:info
heroku login
heroku --version
git remote (this will tell you of any remote repos and their names)



From email to team:

Here’s some things I’ve learnt about managing heroku and remote repositories on the command line, which helped solve the errors Laura was getting

How to hook up your local protoype to an existing heroku app

The prototype kit installation guide kindly helps you add a new app; here’s how to hook your local code up to an existing app. Any time you start working on a different laptop you’re going to have to make sure that the local version of git on there is synced up with any remote repositories you need such as github and heroku. Git doesn’t care or know about these things until you tell it. Github is done automatically if you just clone an existing repository from github.com and open it in the desktop app, but for heroku you need to tell git directly.

So, to connect to an existing heroku app:

1. Open terminal / command line / git bash and navigate to the appropriate prototype folder
…wherever it is on the hard disk

2. Login to heroku on the command line:
heroku login

3. Add an existing heroku app, as opposed to creating a new one – replace your-application-name here:
git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/your-application-name.git

Note:
•	“heroku” in this command is nothing more than the name you are assigning this remote repository. You could call it anything you like, or be more specific e.g. heroku-mb-prototype – but whatever you do you’ll have to type every time you want to push to it. So just calling it “heroku” is simplest
•	You can just edit the .git url above for your application. You’ll also find this if you log in to heroku on the web and go into the app settings and look for “Git URL”

4. Then you can test by going:
git push heroku

•	…Assuming you called it “heroku”
•	This will push everything you have committed locally out to heroku, and tell you when it’s done so you can then browse to the app URL and check it out


Other useful heroku / remote repo related commands

Find out whether git on this computer knows about any connected remote/online repositories – it will list them if so:
git remote 

Find out what git knows specifically about any connected heroku apps:
heroku apps:info

Check what version of the heroku toolbet/command line is installed – this also triggers an auto update:
heroku --version

Get rid of a connection to a remote repo such as a heroku app or even github:
git remote remove <remote-repo-name>

So, say you had your code hooked up to an old heroku app, which you had called “heroku”, you would type:
git remote remove heroku

.. then enter this to check it’s no longer listed:
git remote

Given this, if you like to live life on the edge then you could hook up your code to two or more different heroku apps by using a different name as above e.g. git remote add heroku2 https://git.heroku.com/second-application-name.git. But life is short and it’s probably best to keep a one-to-one mapping and just build different journey URLs into your single prototype.

It also follows that the name “origin” is just a convention for referring to github.com, based on the assumption that it’s your primary online code storage.

And finally – getting more help

If git remote isn’t quite clear enough and you need more info (or you chose to live life on the edge and can’t remember what name points where exactly), use the ‘verbose’ mode of the command which will tell you the different URLs in question:
git remote -v

Also useful is:
git <command> help
e.g:
git remote help

That tells you what your options are for a given command, and is the source – with some trial and error – of most of the above. For heroku it’s the other way round:
heroku help <command>
Or
heroku <command> --help

e.g:
heroku help apps
heroku apps --help
